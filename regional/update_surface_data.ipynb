    "Answer: The coordinates at the center of the WRF grid that overlaps CZ2 are slightly different to the coordinates of CZ2 itself. The curstom algorithm above therefore pulls data from the surface data at an adjacent (but not the same) cell as if you input CZ2 coordinates themselves. This is OK and expected. We have to pull soil data algorithmically based on the nearest neighbor to the center of each WRF grid cell. The fact that the vegetation dyanmcis are so different with this small change in soil data is problematic from a model structure perspective."
